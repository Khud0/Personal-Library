# Personal-Library

If you have a lot of books at your home and want to make a catalogue of them - Personal Library is the tool to use!

PL allows you to store all of your books in one place for fast sorting and searching between them.
You can add all of the "basic" information, including the Author, Name, Publisher, Year of Publishing and similar things,
as well as your own notes.
